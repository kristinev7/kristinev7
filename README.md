## Hi there I'm Kristine👋

I’m a full-stack developer who builds **Java/Spring Boot** backends and **React / Next.js / React Native (Expo)** frontends.  
I enjoy designing clean APIs, secure authentication flows, and smooth user interfaces.  
I also have experience with **data analytics** and **computer vision** through internship projects.

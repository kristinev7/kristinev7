## Hi there I'm Kristine👋

I’m a full-stack developer who builds **Java/Spring Boot** backends and **React / Next.js / React Native (Expo)** frontends.  
I enjoy designing clean APIs, secure authentication flows, and smooth user interfaces.  
I also have experience with **data analytics** and **computer vision** through internship projects.

### 🛠️ Tech I Use

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, JWT, SQL, Apache Kafka  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, React Native / Expo, TypeScript  
- **Other:** Docker, Git, Python (ML/CV), data visualization, GSAP, WebSocket

### 📌 Featured Projects

- **Developer Portfolio** – React / Next.js  
  Personal portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.  
  Showcases my projects, skills, and professional experience.

  🔗 *Live site:* [kristine-dev](https://kristine-dev.replit.app/)
  
- **Real-Time Event Streaming and Monitoring Platform - Polling vs Pushing** – Spring Boot + React + Apache Kafka  
  A real-time, event-driven data streaming platform built with Apache Kafka and Spring Boot to ingest, process, and expose continuous event data.
  This project focuses on distributed backend architecture, stream processing, and a deliberate comparison between polling-based and push-based data delivery models.
  The system currently uses REST polling, with WebSocket-based push delivery.

- **Cross-Platform Employee Management System** – React Native / Expo + Spring Boot  
 A cross-platform employee management system built with a Spring Boot REST API and a MySQL persistence layer, consumed by mobile and web clients built using React Native (Expo).

- **Spring JWT Auth System** – Spring Boot + React Native / Expo  
  A Spring Boot application focused on understanding authentication and authorization with Spring Security (local login, federated identity, and JWTs), as well as securing REST endpoints.

- **Data Analytics Dashboard** – React  
  Interactive dashboard with charts, graphs, and responsive UI for data exploration.
